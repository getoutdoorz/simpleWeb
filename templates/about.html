		Hi! We are Tony Murphy and Cade Curry -- two ADHD-ridden 
		college students who have always shared an interest in 
		thinking.  Through continual reflection on our own 
		experiences, we collectively came to believe that the 
		important things in life are often overlooked or put second 
		to what is societally valued -- making money, receiving 
		validation from others, etc. If there is one thing which we 
		learned from our time at college, it is that individuals 
		often feel the need to live their lives a certain way and 
		succumb to the pressures of society.  By living their lives 
		according to societally defined standards, either consciously 
		or unconsciously, these individuals fail to recognize the true 
		value of their existence and often fail to be happy.

		Growing up in a world with seemingly limitless possibilities, 
		it is important to recognize one’s time alive as a nonrenewable 
		resource. A resource that shouldn’t be used towards seeking 
		validation from others or sulking in boredom and envy. Instead, 
		our time should be spent living--pursuing happiness with genuine 
		people. 

		When we first met, we had no idea that we would soon attend 
		adjacent universities and become water polo teammates, 
		door-to-door neighbors, and business partners.  To this 
		day, we both strive to simplify life, encouraging people 
		to spend their priceless time efficiently rather than 
		letting time escape.  Through Outside, we attempt to 
		provide people with a means to do, so that less time 
		is wasted or spent in boredom.
